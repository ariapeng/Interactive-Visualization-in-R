# Interactive-Visualization-with-R

Hi, there.
I'm a two-dog owner, and I love purchasing dog food and supplies from Chewy.com. It is an e-commerce giant in pet food field. So let's find out public opinion on its service.
First, I web scrapped needed data for all dog food at Chewy.com, cleaned them, then did some statistical analysis.
    Code of this part was in the file named `Code_webscrapping.R`.
Second, I performed interactive visualization of these data, uploaded them on Shiny apps.
    Code of this part was in the file named `Code_shinyapps.R`.
Last, the shiny apps link is posted.

Hope you like the project. Please feel free to comment if you have any questions.
